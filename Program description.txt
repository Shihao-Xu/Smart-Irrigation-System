Program design:
    In this project, python is used in processing data and making prediction. We 
process the weather information firstly, and then we use different plans to caluculat 
the daily water by evapotranspiration and monthly water uage. The code of this part is  
'dataprocess.ipynb'.
So, we have taining dataset by now, the following steps are chooseing different machine 
learning moodel, and using them on our taining dataset individually, our choices are
KNN model, linear model, kernal model and decision tree model. we implementation them 
in the following 4 files: 'DT.ipynb','Kernal.ipynb','KNN.ipynb','Linear.ipynb'.
Before we use these 4 models on all dataset, it should be easy to just use these models
on one kind of crop(we have 3 kinds of crop). so we design a file to make prediction on
rice using these 4 models, and compare their performance, this part is in'Monthlycompa-
re.ipynb'. After compare the performances, we found that DT model is better for our prediction.
Improvements:
   Our project just collect maximum and minimum temperature, radiation and rainfall, so 
if we can have more weather information about our study area, may be we can get more 
precise predictionwe plan to find other factors related to water usage as features. 
Finding more training data and trying other parameters in different models are also
good ways to decrease the MAE
