Setup and execute
All our program files are ipynb files, which excute on jupyter notebook. 
There is no need to setup when executing on another computer, we witer 
our code on jupyter notbook, so it is necessary to install jupyter notebook,
an also when we use machine learning models, we import sklearn packeage, so
install this packeage is also necessary.
