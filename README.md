# The purpose of the project:

The widespread use of the Internet of Things in agriculture 
has profoundly affected the way agriculture works. We use 
IoT technology to predict the amount of irrigation on the 
farm by using various weather data and irrigation data 
collected by the farm. Predictive results can be used to 
understand irrigation and save water. After we got datasets,
we combine them into a training dataset, and our system 
predict daily water usage by applying different machine 
learning models on our training dataset. According to this
project, farm can access a way to make prediction of daily 
water usage
